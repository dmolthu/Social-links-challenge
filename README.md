## Overview

Social links profile using HTML and CSS. Includes cursor hover interactivity.

## My process

I started with building the page from top to bottom and then once everything that I needed to work with was on my screen, I started styling. Styling was the hardest part for me because of centering certain elements and spacing them out accordingly.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I have leared to get a little more comfortable with using the margin properties to shift my elements where I would like them to be at. Also I experimented with the transition-duration property when you hover over the buttons to make them turn green in a more fade in look.


### Continued development

I want to continue working with transitions and also want to dive into animations. I also want to develop my skills with both the margin and padding properties, so that I can space out any of my elements without guessing where I want it.
